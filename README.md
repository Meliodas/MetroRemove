MetroRemove
===========

Removes start button and Modern UI. It can also lets you open the All Apps view only when you press the Start button on the keyboard (WIP)

This app can hide the start button and can also hide the Modern UI completely (Charms,, Start screen, Hot corners, Metro task switcher).
You will have to rerun the app if explorer.exe restarts though.

Command-line arguments needed:

--metrokill : Hides Modern UI
--startkill : Hides start button
--sbopenav : Lets you open the All Apps view only when you press the Start button on the keyboard (WIP)

Tested on: Windows 8.1 Preview
This is the initial release so things MIGHT not work correctly always. I am working to iron out the bugs..
GUI extension coming soon!
