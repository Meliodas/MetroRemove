MetroRemove (now with GUI)
===========

Removes start button and Modern UI. It can also let you open the All Apps view only when you press the Start button on the keyboard (WIP)

This app can hide the start button and can also hide the Modern UI completely (Charms, Start screen, Hot corners, Metro task switcher).
You will have to rerun the app if explorer.exe restarts though.

Command-line arguments needed:

--killmetro : Hides Modern UI

--killstart : Hides start button

--sbopenav : Lets you open the All Apps view only when you press the Start button on the keyboard (WIP)

** UPDATE ** GUI version now available :) !

Tested on: Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows 8 RTM
This is the initial release so things MIGHT not work correctly always. I am working to iron out the bugs..
